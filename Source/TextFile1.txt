Need To update this to use the JUCE state system
Right now there is a bug where when you change types and go to another plugin you lose your type when coming back
This was fixed with the slider valies but that is because they are handled in the processor and not the editor
There is also a bug where the second slider cant seem to be set to a value over 10
